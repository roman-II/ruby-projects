## Ruby Widget Store:
For this project, I built a small ruby widget store to cover integars. Once user inputs how many widgets they wanted, we print out the price total for them.

#### Usage
``` 
ruby ruby-widget-store/widgets.rb 
```

## Shopping List
This project creates a simple list and display's it after adding all of your items. Still more features that can be added here but it was focusing on loops.

#### Usage
```
ruby shopping-list/shopping_list.rb
```
